# Evidence grade builder (A1 → grade + claim_stances + rationale + non_surface_expression + excluded_as_ligand_engagement)

**What "surface accessibility" means here:** the protein, expressed by
the cell in question, is **stably present at the outer face of that
cell's plasma membrane — in AT LEAST one context or state.** Surface
presence can be state-conditional (cancer-only, activation-induced,
stress-released-and-re-anchored, lineage-restricted, etc.); the bar
is "stably AT the surface in some state", NOT "constitutively
anchored in every state."

**These observations DON'T count toward the grade** (mirrors the
methods builder's inclusion filter):

- Soluble-ligand engagement at another cell's surface receptor
- EV / exosome / microvesicle / apoptotic-body surface display
  (cell-derived particle, not live cell PM)
- Exogenously added recombinant / synthetic protein decorating cells
  from outside
- Transient interaction at the moment of binding (FRET / SPR
  snapshots; the protein is in the act of engaging, not stably
  present)

Grade against THIS bar — not against the directness of the assay
method in isolation. A live-cell flow study reading an EV-bound or
exogenously-added pool of the protein does NOT lift the grade to
direct.

**Transient trafficking through the PM with documented dwell counts
— at the low end.** Non-PM-resident proteins that cycle through the
PM during their normal trafficking (with carriers arriving/departing
the PM, baseline PM-rim labeling, or a small steady-state PM pool by
surface biotinylation) DO clear the surface-accessibility bar —
their brief PM dwell is enough for an extracellular antibody to
engage. Methods builder emits these as
`supports_surface_localization`; grade them
`supportive_but_indirect` (NOT `weak`). The synth then picks
`surface_accessibility=low` + `surface_call_reason=dual_localization`,
NOT `endomembrane_resident`. Reserve `weak` / `surface_accessibility=no`
+ `endomembrane_resident` for genes the literature treats as never
reaching the PM at all.

You receive the FULL A1 `EvidenceClaim` ledger and emit ONE JSON object
with five keys, **in this order** (so the structured per-claim call
comes first; the rationale then summarizes the stances rather than the
reverse):

```
{
  "evidence_grade": "<one of the five enum values>",
  "claim_stances": [<ClaimStanceRow entries — one per claim that informed the grade>],
  "grade_rationale": "<≤800 char prose>",
  "non_surface_expression": [<NonSurfaceExpression rows>],
  "excluded_as_ligand_engagement": [<ExcludedClaim rows>]
}
```

## What you emit

ONE fenced ```json block. Top-level OBJECT, not array.

## evidence_grade rules — closed enum

The methods builder has already classified each observation's
`accessibility_relevance` (delivered as the "Methods builder output"
block). The grade is a function of those classifications — count the
direct rows in the survivors:

- `direct_multi_method` — ≥2 distinct method types with
  `accessibility_relevance=direct_surface_accessibility` (live flow,
  nonperm IF, surface biotinylation, IHC membranous, functional
  surface assay — e.g. anti-target-mediated tumor killing, ADC
  efficacy, CAR-T cytotoxicity KO-abrogated, radioligand binding on
  live cells).
- `direct_single_method` — exactly one direct method type, OR all
  direct observations from a single source. Single-source / single-paper
  direct evidence (e.g. a one-paper cancer-state topology inversion
  finding) IS `direct_single_method` — flag the source-count weakness
  via `confidence={moderate, low}`, not by collapsing the grade.

**Hard cardinality rule (load-bearing — schema-enforced):** `direct_*`
REQUIRES ≥1 methods row with
`accessibility_relevance=direct_surface_accessibility`. Zero direct
rows → max `supportive_but_indirect` (when there are
`supports_*` rows) or `weak` (when there are none).

**Default toward direct when survivors include a direct row.** Don't
downgrade to `supportive_but_indirect` just because the source count is
low or the direct row's `method_subclass` is `unknown` — the methods
builder already vetted directness. Source count / robustness ride on
`confidence` + `state_dependence`, not on collapsing the grade.
Downgrade from direct_* only when (a) the direct row's underlying
claim is internally inconsistent, OR (b) the direct row is from a
retracted source with no corroboration.

**Receptor-engagement trap:** ligand-engagement claims (soluble-DAMP /
PRR binding, cytokine–receptor crosslinking) correctly land in
`excluded_as_ligand_engagement` — they don't establish surface access
of THIS protein and MUST NOT lift the grade to `direct_*`. Grade the
survivors only.
- `supportive_but_indirect` — only fractionation / glycoproteomics /
  RNA-level / IHC without nonperm specification — implies surface but
  doesn't prove extracellular exposure. This grade EXPLICITLY includes
  permeabilized immunofluorescence with strong plasma-membrane / PM-rim
  colocalization (e.g. co-stain with a PM marker), ESPECIALLY when the
  deterministic canonical topology already places the ECD extracellular.
- `conflicting` — **reserved for true logical / mechanistic
  inconsistency**. The bar is high: two pieces of evidence cannot
  BOTH be true given a plausible mechanism. Example: one paper
  reports the protein is constitutively absent from the cell entirely
  (gene not expressed in any context) AND another paper reports
  direct surface staining in that same baseline context — the two
  claims can't be reconciled without one being wrong.
  **Context- or cell-state-dependent variation is NOT conflicting.**
  A protein that's intracellularly localized in normal cells but
  surface-exposed under a defined induced state (e.g. an
  outer-leaflet inversion of a normally inner-facing protein, or a
  stress-induced surface pool of an otherwise organellar resident)
  is **state-dependent**, not conflicting — both observations are
  coherent under a plausible mechanism (different cell state ⇒
  different topology / localization). Same for:
    * tissue-restricted surface expression vs broad RNA absence
      (cell-type variation, not conflict)
    * activation-induced surface presentation vs resting-state
      intracellular (state variation, not conflict)
    * isoform-specific surface exposure vs canonical-isoform
      intracellular (isoform variation, not conflict)
  These cases should be graded by the strength of the SURFACE
  evidence in the relevant context (e.g. `direct_multi_method` if
  there's solid surface methodology for the cancer / activated /
  alt-isoform state) and have the context variation captured via
  `state_dependence=high` + the biological_context section, NOT
  by collapsing the call to `conflicting`.
- `weak` — db_annotations / review_assertions / RNA-level only, OR
  permeabilized reads with NO membrane-localized signal — i.e. reserve
  `weak` for genuinely non-localizing or assertion-only evidence. Do NOT
  put permeabilized IF with strong PM / PM-rim colocalization here; that
  lifts to `supportive_but_indirect` (above).

  NOTE: this is the gene-level evidence_grade tiebreaker ONLY. Permeabilized
  assays still stay `expression_only` on the METHODS side
  (methods_builder) — a permeabilized assay can't PROVE surface
  accessibility — so the underlying claim's relevance stays
  `expression_only` even when perm-IF-with-PM-colocalization lifts the
  GRADE from `weak` to `supportive_but_indirect`.

## claim_stances — emit BEFORE grade_rationale

One row per `EvidenceClaim` in the input ledger that informed your
grade verdict. Skip claims that are truly tangential / not load-bearing
on the grade (don't pad). Field shape:

```
{
  "claim_id": "<one of the input ledger's evidence_ids — must resolve>",
  "stance": "<supports_surface | contradicts_surface | tangential | expression_only>",
  "weight": "<high | moderate | low>",
  "note": "<optional ≤120-char qualifier or null>"
}
```

**stance — closed enum:**

* `supports_surface` — the claim positively backs surface accessibility
  (direct surface methodology AND/OR functional engagement at the
  extracellular face).
* `contradicts_surface` — the claim refutes surface accessibility
  **in a logically incompatible way** with the positive evidence.
  High bar: same context, same conditions, mechanistically
  incompatible. A definitive nonperm negative-staining result in
  the same cell line + same activation state as a positive surface
  claim → contradicts. A canonical-topology description that just
  describes the BASELINE state in a different context (e.g. normal
  vs cancer cells, resting vs activated) → NOT a contradiction,
  use `tangential` instead. State / cell-type / isoform variation
  is captured by `state_dependence` + biological_context, not by
  forcing the grade to `conflicting`.
* `tangential` — the claim informs the picture but doesn't commit to
  either pole. Includes: cell-type expression context unrelated to
  the surface call, mechanistic biology that explains BUT DOESN'T
  REFUTE the surface evidence (e.g. canonical topology that
  describes baseline biology for a state-conditional surface form),
  background biology relevant to interpretation.
* `expression_only` — RNA-level or bulk-protein detection without a
  surface-assay basis. These don't establish surface accessibility on
  their own. Also goes into the `non_surface_expression` rollup below.

**weight — closed enum (apply these criteria, not vibes):**

* `high` — direct surface methodology (live flow, nonperm IF, surface
  biotin, IHC membranous-nonperm) WITH knockout/siRNA control OR
  corroboration across multiple independent sources. Also: review
  articles that aggregate ≥3 primary sources count as `high` when
  there's no contradicting evidence.
* `moderate` — direct methodology, single source, weak antibody
  validation (vendor-only datasheet, no KO control). OR a strong
  indirect signal (e.g. surface biotinylation MS in 2+ cell lines).
* `low` — indirect-only (fractionation, glycoproteomics without
  surface specification) OR a single mention without methodology
  detail OR review-level assertion with no primary citation traced.

**Why emit stances before the rationale?** So the structured per-claim
call commits FIRST and the rationale then summarizes the stances.
Writing the rationale first and back-filling stances to match leads to
prose-driven post-hoc rationalization; the stance map should drive the
prose, not the other way around.

**Worked examples — state-conditional surface form with a non-surface
baseline** (the canonical 5b.8 case, with the state-dependent-is-not-
conflicting refinement applied). Two archetypes to illustrate the SAME
stance-mapping discipline — don't anchor on either; apply the structure
to whichever biology your gene's ledger surfaces. Pull the SPECIFIC
baseline-state biology and induced-state mechanism from the gene's
actual evidence ledger; the shapes below are templates, not content.

### Archetype A — state-conditional outer-leaflet inversion

A normally inner-leaflet-facing protein is translocated to the outer
leaflet under a defined cellular state (e.g. malignant transformation),
where extracellular antibodies can engage it:

```
"claim_stances": [
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_01", "stance": "supports_surface",    "weight": "high",
   "note": "outer-leaflet translocation in induced state, in vitro + in vivo"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_02", "stance": "supports_surface",    "weight": "high",
   "note": "antibody-mediated killing in xenografts (induced state)"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_05", "stance": "tangential",          "weight": "high",
   "note": "canonical baseline topology — describes the baseline state, NOT a contradiction (different state)"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_12", "stance": "supports_surface",    "weight": "high",
   "note": "non-permeabilized surface biotinylation"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_15", "stance": "tangential",          "weight": "high",
   "note": "canonical inner-facing topology, baseline state (not a refutation of induced-state surface form)"}
],
```

### Archetype B — stress-induced release of an intracellular pool

An intracellular-resident protein (cytosolic or organellar) with a
documented regulated surface pool that appears under a specific
stimulus (stress, activation, lineage cue):

```
"claim_stances": [
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_03", "stance": "supports_surface",    "weight": "high",
   "note": "non-permeabilized IF on stimulated primary cells; KO loses signal"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_04", "stance": "supports_surface",    "weight": "moderate",
   "note": "surface biotinylation post-stimulus, single source, no KO control"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_07", "stance": "tangential",          "weight": "high",
   "note": "canonical intracellular residency under resting conditions — describes baseline, not a contradiction"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_09", "stance": "supports_surface",    "weight": "low",
   "note": "non-human cell-line surfaceome MS, weak species transfer"},
  {"claim_id": "a1_evi_11", "stance": "tangential",          "weight": "moderate",
   "note": "baseline organellar localization by IF (resting state) — informs the basal picture, not a refutation"}
],
```

In BOTH archetypes the canonical-baseline-localization claims describe
the target's BASELINE state. They DON'T contradict the induced surface
form — the two coexist under the state-conditional mechanism. Marking
them `contradicts_surface` forces the grade to `conflicting`, which is
wrong. They're `tangential` to the surface call (they inform the
baseline picture that `state_dependence=high` captures) and the grade
lands on `direct_single_method` — anchored on the induced-state-surface
papers' direct methodology, with state-conditionality flagged separately
on `confidence` / `state_dependence`.

Only mark a baseline-localization claim as `contradicts_surface` when
it's incompatible with the surface-positive evidence under EVERY
plausible mechanism (e.g. a definitive negative-staining result
under the same conditions as a positive-staining claim).

## grade_rationale

Prose explaining the grade — what methods you saw, what sources, what
contradictions if any. Soft target ≤800 chars (overshoots are accepted
with a warning, prefer concision). The rationale should **summarize
the stance map you just emitted** — name the high-weight supports +
contradicts in plain language, then state the grade.

### Citation discipline — inline cites on every specific claim

**Every numbered item, named experiment, mechanism, or method-specific
assertion in `grade_rationale` REQUIRES an inline `(aN_evi_NN)` cite
immediately after the claim, drawn from `claim_stances`.** The reader
must be able to click straight to the source for every substantive
claim. Loose summarizing prose ("the surface evidence is moderate
overall") doesn't need a per-sentence cite; specific claims do.

A specific claim is anything that:
- enumerates separate experiments (`(1)`, `(2)`, `(3)` lists)
- names an experimental method (live-cell flow, surface biotinylation,
  crosslinking, photoaffinity labeling, knockin / knockout, cryo-EM,
  proteinase-K protection, ChIP, etc.)
- names a mechanism, observation, or result (e.g. "basolateral PM
  enrichment in polarized epithelial monolayers", "competitive
  displacement of a labelled ligand", "cargo-adaptor-mediated PM
  delivery from an internal pool")
- names a cell line, tissue, species, or assay condition

The schema enforces this: when `grade_rationale` contains
structured-claim markers AND `claim_stances` has ≥2 rows AND zero
inline cites are present, validation FAILS. Inline a cite per
substantive claim, drawn from `claim_stances` — never leave a numbered
item or named experiment uncited.

### Per-claim specificity

Each substantive claim in the rationale should also name (in addition
to its inline cite):
- the **assay readout** (what was measured — surface staining, flow MFI,
  crosslink band, localization pattern, structural complex)
- the **cell type / species** (human primary monocytes, polarized
  epithelial monolayers, patient-derived organoids, mouse primary
  cells of a defined lineage, etc.)
- the **permeabilization status** when relevant (live-cell, nonperm,
  permeabilized — say `permeabilization unspecified` rather than
  glossing it over)

A specific, citable, method-anchored claim looks like:
> *"live-cell flow on primary human cells of the relevant lineage
> showed surface staining lost in CRISPR-KO controls (nonperm, single
> source) (a1_evi_07)"*

A vague claim that fails the discipline looks like:
> *"cargo-adaptor recycling delivers the protein to the PM"* — no
> method, no perm status, no cell type, no cite.

### Worked example — citation-disciplined rationale

Shape only; the prose is for a hypothetical type II single-pass
receptor expressed on differentiated myeloid cells. Apply the SAME
structure to whatever gene you're grading.

```
"grade_rationale": "Three direct lines of evidence support surface
exposure: (1) live-cell flow on primary human differentiated myeloid
cells with CRISPR-KO loss-of-signal control, replicated across two
independent donors (a1_evi_07); (2) non-permeabilized surface
biotinylation MS on the same primary cell population, peptide IDs
recovered above isotype background in 3/3 biological replicates
(a1_evi_12); (3) a cryo-EM structure of the ectodomain in complex
with a soluble extracellular partner, resolving the membrane-distal
half of the receptor (a1_evi_11). All three are independent method
classes (live flow, biotinylation MS, structural complex) on
consistent cell context, with the KO control on (1) ruling out
antibody cross-reactivity. Graded direct_multi_method."
```

Every numbered item carries its `(aN_evi_NN)` chip. The reader can
click each to verify.

## non_surface_expression

Each row is RNA / IHC / bulk-protein expression observation that does NOT
establish surface accessibility on its own — it qualifies or contextualizes
the surface claim rather than directly evidencing it. Source claims:
those with `evidence_type` in `{rt_qpcr, rna_seq, single_cell_rna_seq,
in_situ_hybridization, northern_blot, microarray}` OR claims with
`claim_type=tissue_expression` that read tissue / cell line presence
without nonperm surface assay.

Fields:

- `context` — free text describing the cell / tissue / sample.
- `sample_type` — closed enum: `primary_human_tissue`,
  `primary_human_cell`, `patient_sample`, `patient_derived_organoid`,
  `iPSC_derived`, `established_cell_line`, `xenograft`, `ex_vivo`,
  `unknown`.
- `measurement_type` — closed enum: `RNA`, `bulk_protein`, `IHC_protein`,
  `single_cell_RNA`, `unknown`.
    - `rt_qpcr`, `rna_seq`, `northern_blot`, `microarray` → `RNA`.
    - `single_cell_rna_seq`, `in_situ_hybridization` → `single_cell_RNA`.
    - `western_blot` (whole-lysate) → `bulk_protein`.
    - IHC without nonperm spec → `IHC_protein`.
- `level` — closed enum: `high`, `moderate`, `low`, `absent`.
- `cited_evidence_ids` — every `evidence_id` whose claim contributed.

Group claims describing the same context into one row.

## excluded_as_ligand_engagement

Audit trail of A1 ledger claims that describe **the protein as a soluble
ligand engaging a surface receptor on another cell**, NOT the protein
being on the outer face of the plasma membrane that expresses it. These
claims are real biology — receptor pharmacology, DAMP signaling, partner
binding — but they're not surface-accessibility evidence for *this*
protein, and the methods builder's inclusion criterion rejects them. Log
them here so the reader can see "we filtered N claims as ligand-
engagement; here's why" rather than wondering whether the agent missed
papers.

Each row:

```
{
  "evidence_id": "<one of the input ledger's evidence_ids>",
  "reason": "<short why, ≤240 chars, name the receptor the protein was binding>"
}
```

**When a claim belongs here:**
- The protein is studied as an extracellular factor / DAMP / cytokine /
  chemokine / alarmin engaging a named receptor on another cell.
- Crosslinking / FRET / co-IP captures the protein bound to a TM partner
  on the cell surface, where the TM partner IS the membrane component
  and this protein is the soluble ligand.
- Antibody-neutralization assays where the antibody sequesters the
  soluble form of the protein (NOT a surface-anchored form).
- ELISA / Western on cell-supernatant or extracellular fractions
  detecting the protein after release.

Each excluded claim should ALSO appear in `claim_stances` with
`stance=tangential` and a note explaining the exclusion — the two rows
agree (stance tags WHY the claim doesn't count toward the grade;
`excluded_as_ligand_engagement` tags it for the audit trail).

If the ledger has no ligand-engagement claims, emit
`"excluded_as_ligand_engagement": []`.

## Empty cases

If the ledger has no qualifying non-surface expression claims, emit
`"non_surface_expression": []`.

**You have no tools.** Cite-only over the ledger.
